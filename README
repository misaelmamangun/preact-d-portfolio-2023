# Portfolio

## Overview

A portfolio is a curated collection of projects, achievements, and experiences that represent an individual's skills and abilities. It serves as a comprehensive snapshot of one's professional and sometimes personal journey. Portfolios are commonly used by individuals in various fields, including software development, design, writing, and more, to showcase their talents and accomplishments.
